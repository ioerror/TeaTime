TeaTime: TLS Estimates Accurate Timing Information More Entropically

TeaTime guesses the remote system time based on information leaked
from the remote SSL/TLS ServerHello message.

Example usage:

  teatime.py -u -s -v -x -r secwiki.org

  We're checking the time by connecting to secwiki.org
  We believe that the local time is : 1315569627.7
  asctime() says: Fri Sep  9 14:00:27 2011
  The remote system secwiki.org believes that TeaTime is : 1315569632.0
  asctime() says: Fri Sep  9 14:00:32 2011
  The remote HTTPS system secwiki.org believes that HTTPSTime is : Fri, 09 Sep
  2011 12:00:33 GMT
  The remote HTTP system secwiki.org believes that HTTPTime is : Fri, 09 Sep 2011
  12:00:37 GMT

Example with TLS and SNTP:

  teatime.py -n -v -r pool.ntp.org

  We're checking the time by connecting to pool.ntp.org
  We believe that the local time is : 1315569583.28
  asctime() says: Fri Sep  9 13:59:43 2011
  The remote system pool.ntp.org believes that TeaTime is : 1315569587.0
  asctime() says: Fri Sep  9 13:59:47 2011
  The remote system pool.ntp.org believes that SNTP is : 1315569587.0
  asctime() says: Fri Sep  9 13:59:47 2011
